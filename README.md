<b> Financial Modeling Leads to â€¦ Happiness? </b>

Bear with me. I often find myself asking: "What do I need to do now (or not do), to prepare for future needs?"  Much of what gives a sense of purpose (happiness?) in day-to-day life is what it all adds up to. I had to get more quantitative to make my expectations real, or there will be little confidence that I am tracking toward my version of happiness. I continued the mind-map exercise, but in Excel. The end result looked something like this.
